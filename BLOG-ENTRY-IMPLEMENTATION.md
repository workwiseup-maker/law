## Backend Integration Notes

The form is fully prepared for backend integration. To connect to a database:

2. Create backend endpoint (PHP, Node.js, etc.)

4. Validate slug uniqueness server-side
5. Save to database
6. Return success/error response

Example AJAX code is already included in comments within `blog-entry.html`.

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
